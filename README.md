# project_voice
 
This project is the voice part of the robot that i am building which focuses on the robot's abilty to hear and speak. 

Till now i have created my own wake word model for the robot and the robot does respond to the wake word whenever spoken.

Along with the wake word it also includes the ability to find the direction of voice from where the wake word is spoken.
